# hospital-database-management-system
The project “Hospital management system” is aimed to develop to maintain the day–to-day state of admission/discharge of patients, list of doctors, reports generation, etc. It is designed to achieve the following objectives:  1. To computerise all details regarding patient details &amp; hospital details. 2. Scheduling the appointment of patients with doctors to make it convenient for both. 3. Scheduling the services of specialised doctors and emergencies properly so that facilities provided by hospitals are fully utilised in an effective and efficient manner. 4. If the medical store issues medicines to patients, it should reduce the stock status of the medical store and vice-versa. 5.  It should be able to handle the test reports of patients conducted in the pathology lab of the hospital. 6. The inventory should be updated automatically whenever a transaction is made. 7. The information of the patients should be kept up to date and their records should be kept in the system for historical purposes.
